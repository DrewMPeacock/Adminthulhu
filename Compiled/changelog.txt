 - Added catagories to log messages, making it easier to see what is what.
 - Critical error type messages now halt the process, after which it waits for input.
 - Added an autopatcher.
 - Fixed an issue where empty strings in config would return null.
 - Legal junk now shows how many it's about to send to, but doesn't show anything if that is zero.
