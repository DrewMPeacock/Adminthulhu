Very small patch, though I'm using it as an excuse to send a message.
 * Possibly fixed younglings again. thi- fo- sixth times the charm!

As I've already mentioned on the hub server, the Discord.NET which this bot is based on seems to be on a freeze. From what I've heard, this is due to some C# stuff not yet available for .NET Core, something quite critial for many bots. Point is that the API is getting outdated, which might cause strange issues to occur. You should still report these issues though, just in case they are on my end. Channel catagories aren't supported due to this, and consequently I'm unable to implement what I've been wanting to for a while, the "Forum".
