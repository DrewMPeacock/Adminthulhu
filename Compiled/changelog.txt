It's a big one, boys!

 - Largely revamped how commands work internally.
	* Commands now support overloading, as in multiple commands under the same name.
	* Commands now return values, and can be chained together to long "Pipes".
	* Custom commands can be created and saved from such chained commands.
	* Way less tedious to write new commands.
	* <Command> ? shows return values as well as input types.

 - New command catagory: Advanced
 - New commands.
	* A command set revolving Discord data, such as members, channels and roles.
	* A command set revolving simple Math operations, will be expanded.
	* A command set revolving flow of commands, such af if, for and delay commands.
	* A misc command set where uncatagorised advanced commands go.
	* !define - Which graps the definition of its input from Urban Dictionary.
	* !print - Prints out whatever is put into it.

 - Added WHICKED GREAPHIX MAN to the Hangman game.
 - On user joined messages can now show who's invite was used.

THIS ENTIRE PATCH IS EXPERIMENTAL.
