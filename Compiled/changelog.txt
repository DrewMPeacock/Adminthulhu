Command code cleanup!
 * Cleaned up and improved command execution code.
	- Fixed commands which take in a params type parameter, effectively fixing a lot of broken commands, including all custom. 
	- Code is much cleaner, now looks more like a house-of-cardbox than a house-of-cards.
	- Wrapping curly brackets around text is now synonymous to using !var getl <name>, for instance "{arg0}" = "!var getl arg0"
 * Fixed opt-in/out usersettings commands being broken. 
 * Added experimental command caching feature, which will cache all ~200 commands. This allows you to type !sin instead of !math sin, however !math sin still works fine. It currently just executes the first one found in case of conflicts.
 * Fixed birthdays not giving numbers the correct suffix under certain conditions.
 * Fixed !math graph effectively crashing the bot when typing in limited-range functions.
