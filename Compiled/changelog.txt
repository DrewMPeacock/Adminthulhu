MAJOR STUFF
 * Permissions - Roles and users can now have admin-defined bot specific permissions. Current system is a bit barebones, but fully functional and easy to expand. Permissions are quite self-explanatory, but for the record:
	- VoteForEvents - Defines if the role or user can vote for weekly events.
	- LockChannels - Defines if the role or user can lock voice channels.
	- CreateEvents - Defines if a role or user can create custom events.
	- CreateCustomCommands - Defines if a role or user can create custom command chains and save them.
	- UseAdvancedCommands - Defines if a role or user can use commands in the Advanced catagory.
Permissions works similar to how Discords own build-in role hirachy works, where permissions are either disallowed, inherited or allowed. Higher roles in Discords hirachy overwrites lesser roles, or inherits their settings based on the permission. User-specific permissions are considered over any role. Additionally, they are insanely easy to expand upon, so feel free to suggest more.

MINOR STUFF
 * !setconfig commands now take in a Regular Expression and is through that able to edit multiple configuration entries at once. Additionally, a list of all matching entries as well as a "Confirm" question has been added.
 * Attempted yet another fix at the youngling system. I've also temporarily disabled the younglings file encryption, in order to perhaps diagnose the problem through that.
 * Now supports special messages if users where kicked automatically by the bot, currently only used by the Youngling system.
 * Fixed InviteHandler crashing if the bot doesn't have permission to access invites.
 * Fixed event edit commands having old-style arguments, effectively disabling them. Should now work.
 * Changed a few commands from using params to to just multiple overloads. May or may not do a proper fix at some point in the future.
 * Added a fuckload of dice.
 * Listing commands now returns a special response if no commands were available, instead of an empty codeblock.
