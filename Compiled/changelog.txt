I felt inspired and did some stuff, and now you get to play with it.
 * Fixed !math equals being bigoted.
 * Added !callstack command, which shows which commands were executed in a chain.
 * Added !math graph command, which draws graphs of given math functions.
 * Cleaned a tiny bit of the flustercluck that is commands internals.
