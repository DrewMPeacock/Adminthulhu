Experimental stuff incoming!
 * Automated commands, autocs for short!
	- Can run any command chain after certain events.
	- Highly experimental, may crash bot and/or destroy universe.
	- Generally awfully executed!
 * Added math commands to convert between radians and degrees.
 * Added !math pi, which unsurprisingly returns tau. Jk, it's pi.
 * !math graph now attempts to draw full curve instead of just drawing dots for each x-point.
