An update of minor polishes and commands!
 * Heavily optimized configuration loading code.
 * !setconfig now automatically reloads only the affected configuration keys. No longer is !reloadconfig neccesary after changing something. 
 * All admin commands moved into a single command set.
 * Fixed a few commands using the old argument system.
 * Fixed an issue with command variables.
 * Fixed automated quotes adding multiple of the same quite.
 * Added !misc log, which logs stuff to the console.
 * Added !flow foreach, which runs a loop for each item in a given array.
 * Added a buttload of new Discord related commands.
 * Added new autoc events for when a user is stricken and lifted.

There are still more commands I want to add, but I'm out of time for now, so I figured just to push this patch out.
