Another quite small QoL patch, I'm running out of stuff to do here guys!
 * Fixed command chains without arguments not working.
 * Reverted phrases to before they used RegEx, since it seems RegEx doesn't play well with the JSON config.
 * Added a new karma overload, !karma (int amount) shows top karma hoarders on a server.
 * Added automatic conversion of mentions to objects, for instance !discord user kick !discord user find <USER> is the same as !discord user kick @<USER>. This works for text channels and roles as well.
