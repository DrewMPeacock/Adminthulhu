Nothing major today, just a small QoL patch.
 * Fixed a very minor issue with manual tampering with autoc files.
 * Fixed some command requirements not being set properly in sets.
 * Fixed command help occasionally showing twice.
 * Added a new command help embed, arguably more user friendly and a lot easier on the eyes.
 * Added !settings advcommands, which toggles if command help shows return and argument types.
 * Very minor internal changes.
