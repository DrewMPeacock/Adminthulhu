A patch full of minor QoL improvements once more, seems to be all we're getting recently.
 * Mentions as command arguments now return null if mentioned object somehow didn't exist.
 * Added a large amount of command overloads for easier use, most notably for !event create.
 * Added !event get command, which just gets the event object for whatever usage you want.
 * Fixed a critical issue with asynchronous commands softcrashing the bot, this most notably affected commands using a questionaire.
 * Added the ability to set bot application culture manually, this can affect certain parsing and printing, most notably of dates.
