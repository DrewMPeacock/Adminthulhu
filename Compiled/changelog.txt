I'm gonna have to leave command chaining as it is now, since I've made a bit a mess of it, and based on its usage isn't really a priority. It's a bit broken when it comes to arrays, and I'll rework the chaining functionaliity at some point in the fugure, but for now, I'll focus on other stuff.

So here are the patchnotes for this one regardless.
 - Kind of broke some command chaining ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

 - Added saveable variables through commands. Don't quote me on this, but I think this makes the commands turing-complete.
	* Works in three scopes, global, personal and local.
	* Global is for the entire server, only editable by admins.
	* Personal is per-user, and is completely private-ish.
	* Local is per command chain, they are cleared automatically when a command chain ends execution.

 - Karma now does something.
	* An upper bound set in config saves the message as a quote for the !qoute command. Disabled if zero.
	* A lower bound set in config deletes the message. Disabled if zero.
	* Quotes are also moved into their own file, and now ignores the quotes set in config. Data should be copy-pasteable.

 - Fixed the !wait command, now takes in commands properly.
 - Added command !split, which half-assedly does nothing except except take in arguments.
 - Added a litteral shitload of new math commands.
 - Moved a large part of the !misc set into a new !var array set
 - Inviter detector thingie now considers a previously unknown invite at one use the used one.
 - May or may not have fixed questions.
 - Fixed some commands having the wrong catagory.
