A minor hotfix to fix a critical issue during setup.
 * Fixed generated config file never being saved if server ID wasn't manually set.
 * Server ID is now set automatically if not already set.
 * Phrases now use RegEx expressions. T'was a minor thing.
 * Limited maximum interpolation distance for !math graph to avoid near-infinite loops.
